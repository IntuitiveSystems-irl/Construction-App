SUBCONTRACT SERVICES AGREEMENT

This SUBCONTRACT SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the {{day}} day of {{month}}, {{year}} (the "Effective Date"), by and between NDS Ventures LLC d/b/a Veritas Building Group, a Washington limited liability company ("Prime Contractor"), and {{subcontractor_company_name}} a {{subcontractor_state}} {{subcontractor_entity_type}} ("Subcontractor").

WHEREAS, Prime Contractor and {{end_customer_name}} ("End Customer") entered into the Construction Agreement, dated the {{underlying_agreement_day}} day of {{underlying_agreement_month}}, {{underlying_agreement_year}}, for the provision by Prime Contractor of the services specified therein ("Underlying Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, Prime Contractor and Subcontractor desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which Prime Contractor subcontracts its obligation to perform a portion of the services under the Underlying Agreement to Subcontractor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, terms, and conditions set out herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Subcontracted Services. Prime Contractor shall subcontract to Subcontractor, and Subcontractor shall perform, the services (the "Subcontracted Services") set out in Exhibit A. Subcontractor shall assume toward Prime Contractor all obligations and responsibilities that Prime Contractor assumes under the Underlying Agreement toward End Customer. Prime Contractor shall have the benefit of all rights, remedies, and redress against Subcontractor that End Customer, under the Underlying Agreement, has against Prime Contractor, to the extent applicable to this Agreement. This Agreement governs in case of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Underlying Agreement. Subcontractor acknowledges that (a) Prime Contractor has furnished a copy of the Underlying Agreement to Subcontractor upon Subcontractor's written request, and (b) Subcontractor has read the copy of, and understands its obligations under, the Underlying Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Subcontractor (i) shall perform the Subcontracted Services to the satisfaction of Prime Contractor and (ii) shall not subcontract the Subcontracted Services.

2. Fees and Expenses. For the Subcontracted Services to be performed hereunder, Prime Contractor shall pay to Subcontractor (against Subcontractor's invoice) a fixed fee of ${{contract_amount}} (the "Fee"). Prime Contractor has the right to reduce the Fee upon three (3) days' notice based on any decrease in the fee to be paid under the Underlying Agreement by End Customer to Prime Contractor related to the Subcontracted Services. Subcontractor acknowledges that Prime Contractor receives payment from End Customer under the Underlying Agreement only upon full and final acceptance of the services provided under the Underlying Agreement, including the Subcontracted Services. Subcontractor therefore agrees that Prime Contractor shall pay the Fee within ten (10) days after Prime Contractor receives all monies due from End Customer to Prime Contractor under the Underlying Agreement for the Subcontracted Services. The Fee is inclusive of the cost of all materials used for the provision of the Services. Subcontractor shall furnish, at its cost, a performance and payment bond in an amount equal to the Fee and in form and substance satisfactory to Prime Contractor.

Subcontractor agrees that the total compensation for the Subcontracted Services shall not exceed the price stated in this Agreement. Subcontractor may not charge, invoice, or request payment for any amount above the agreed-upon price unless Prime Contractor has expressly approved the increase in a written and signed change order issued before the additional work or expense is incurred. Any work performed or costs incurred without such written authorization shall be deemed included in the original Agreement price, and Subcontractor shall not be entitled to additional compensation. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any payment stub, invoice, or other payment-related document issued by the Subcontractor, this Agreement shall prevail.

3. Term. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue thereafter until the completion of the Subcontracted Services unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 4.

4. Termination. Either Party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to the other Party (the "Defaulting Party"), if the Defaulting Party: (a) breaches this Agreement, and such breach is incapable of cure, or with respect to a breach capable of cure, the Defaulting Party does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach; (b) becomes insolvent or admits its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; (c) becomes subject, voluntarily or involuntarily, to any proceeding under any domestic or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency law, which is not fully stayed within seven (7) business days or is not dismissed or vacated within forty-five (45) days after filing; (d) is dissolved or liquidated or takes any corporate action for such purpose; (e) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (f) has a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent appointed by order of any court of competent jurisdiction to take charge of or sell any material portion of its property or business. Prime Contractor may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to Subcontractor, if the Underlying Agreement terminates for any reason.

5. Effect of Expiration or Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Subcontractor shall promptly: (a) deliver to Prime Contractor all documents, work product, and other materials, whether or not complete, prepared by or on behalf of Subcontractor in the course of performing the Subcontracted Services; (b) return to Prime contractor all Prime Contractor-owned and End Customer-owned property, equipment, or materials in its possession or control; (c) remove any Subcontractor-owned property, equipment, or materials located at Prime Contractor's and End Customer's locations; (d) deliver to Prime Contractor, all documents and tangible materials (and any copies) containing, reflecting, incorporating, or based on any Confidential Information; (e) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Prime Contractor upon Prime Contractor's written request, in transitioning the Subcontracted Services to an alternate subcontractor; (f) on a pro rata basis, repay all fees and expenses paid in advance for any Subcontracted Services which have not been provided; (g) permanently erase all Confidential Information from its computer systems; and (h) certify in writing to Prime Contractor that it has complied with the requirements of this Section 5.

6. Independent Contractor. It is understood and acknowledged that in providing the Subcontracted Services, Subcontractor acts in the capacity of an independent contractor and not as an employee or agent of the Prime Contractor. Subcontractor shall control the conditions, time, details, and means by which Subcontractor performs the Subcontracted Services. Prime Contractor shall have the right to inspect the work of Subcontractor as it progresses solely for the purpose of determining whether the work is completed according to this Agreement. Subcontractor has no authority to commit Prime Contractor or bind Prime Contractor to any obligation or liability or to act for or on behalf of Prime Contractor. Subcontractor and its employees shall be ineligible for and shall not receive any employee benefits from Prime Contractor, and Subcontractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, FICA, federal and state unemployment insurance contributions, state disability premiums, and all similar taxes and fees relating to the fees paid to Subcontractor hereunder.

7. Indemnification. Subcontractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Prime Contractor and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, (collectively, "Losses"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Prime Contractor arising out of or occurring in connection with Subcontractor's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Subcontractor shall not enter into any settlement without Prime Contractor's or Indemnified Parties' prior written consent.

8. Compliance with Law. Subcontractor is in compliance with and shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. Subcontractor has and shall maintain in effect all the licenses, permissions, authorizations, consents, and permits that it needs to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.

9. Insurance. During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Subcontractor shall, at its own expense, maintain and carry insurance in full force and effect with financially sound and reputable insurers, that includes, but is not limited to, commercial general liability with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, including bodily injury and property damage and completed operations and advertising liability, which policy will include contractual liability coverage insuring the activities of Subcontractor under this Agreement. Upon Prime Contractor's request, Subcontractor shall provide Prime Contractor with a certificate of insurance from Subcontractor's insurer evidencing the insurance coverage specified in this Agreement. The certificate of insurance shall name Prime Contractor as an additional insured. Subcontractor shall provide Prime Contractor with thirty (30) days' advance written notice in the event of a cancellation or material change in Subcontractor's insurance policy. Except where prohibited by law, Subcontractor shall require its insurer to waive all rights of subrogation against Prime Contractor's insurers and Prime Contractor or the Indemnified Parties.

10. General. Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, from time to time at the request, furnish the other party such further information or assurances, execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, and conveyances, and take such other actions and do such other things, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall deliver all communications in writing either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, by facsimile or email (with confirmation of transmission), or by recognized overnight courier service, and addressed to the other Party at the addresses set forth above (or to such other address that the receiving Party may designate from time to time in accordance with this section). This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including tort and statutory claims are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Washington without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof [that would result in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Either party shall institute any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the federal or state courts in each case located in Seattle, Washington. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY: (A) CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS; (B) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THAT CHOICE OF FORUM BASED ON VENUE OR TO THE EFFECT THAT THE FORUM IS NOT CONVENIENT; AND (C) WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties with respect to such subject matter. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. The Parties may not amend this Agreement except by written instrument signed by the Parties. No waiver of any right, remedy, power, or privilege under this Agreement ("Right(s)") is effective unless contained in a writing signed by the Party charged with such waiver.

Neither party may directly or indirectly assign, transfer, or delegate any of or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, voluntarily or involuntarily, including by change of control, merger (whether or not such party is the surviving entity), operation of law, or any other manner, without the prior written consent of the other party.
